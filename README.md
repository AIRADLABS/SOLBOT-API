An application programming interface that allows developers in the cryptoverse to anonymously store and access encrypted off-chain data files. The data can be used to power any metaverse, game, dapp, or defi development regardless of its native blockchain ecosystem or programming language. It is our intention to create public  software development kits (sdk's) for multiple popular programming languages to make for a seamless and simple integration.
