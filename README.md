# SOLBOT-API
![solbots.io](http://dev.solbots.io/assets/img/Crypto-Carl-1920x1080.jpg)

An application programming interface that allows developers in the cryptoverse to anonymously store and access encrypted off-chain data files. The data can be used to power any metaverse, game, dapp, or defi development regardless of its native blockchain ecosystem or programming language. We are actively developing software development kits for multiple programming languages to facilitate simple, seamless integrations.

The interface is currently available for TESTING on our DEV NETWORK via dev.solbots.io

It is NOT safe to store any CRITICAL or SENSITIVE data on the network at this time.

The API usage documentation is not yet available, but we'll be adding it soon.
